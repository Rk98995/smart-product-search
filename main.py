    Every time the user says something, identify their intent as one of the following integers:

    1 → The user is requesting a brand new product, either by specifying a name or category directly (e.g., "Show me gaming laptops", "I want to see JBL speakers").  
    2 → The user wants to filter the current product using specific criteria (e.g., color, size, brand, rating).  
    3 → The user wants to sort the current product list based on price or rating. Return either "ascending" or "descending".  
    4 → The user wants to see more results for the current product or category.  
    5 → The user provides a general requirement or use-case without naming a product directly (e.g., "I'm going camping", "I want to bake cakes", "I'm a college student").
    6 → The user wants to filter the current product list as well as sort them at the same time
    7 → The user mentions a new product name and mentions specific filtering criteria at the same time 
    8 → The user provides a general requirement or use-case and mentions specific filtering criteria at the same time

        {"product": "Product Name 3", "description": "keyword-rich short phrase"}
    ],
    "user_response": Natural language response to the user, enquiring about which products to they wish to explore in detail"
    }

    }

    Intent 2 (filtering):

    "intent": 3,
    "sort_order": "descending",
    "sort_by": "price/rating",
    "user_response":"Natural Language response to the user"
    }
    OR

    ],
    "user_response": Natural language response to the user, enquiring about which products to they wish to explore in detail"
    }

    Additional Rules:
    - Always return only the JSON object. Do not include any natural language outside the JSON.
    - For each product, give a short but meaningful description containing the most important searchable keywords.
    - If the user gives a generic product name, like backpack, headphones, shoes, treat them as intent 1/intent 7.
    - If the user asks to go in detail in any of the products mentioned from the response of intent 5, treat it as intent 1, if the user also mentions filtering criteria, treat it as intent 7.
    - Mention the name of the products you identified in intent 5/intent 8 in the user_response.
    - If user asks to sort but doesn't specify the direction, use "ascending" as default.
    - If user wishes to sort on anything other than rating or price, return "invalid" in "sort_order" and "sort_by" and return user_response requesting the user to sort only on basis of price or rating
    - Do not include more than 4 products per list.
    - Avoid repeating product suggestions across turns unless the user resets or re-requests.
    - Intent 5 and 8 are only reserved for when user presents a scenario or a general need, when the user specifically mentions the product by providing the name, like headphones,shoes,cameras etc, they should be considered for intent 1 or intent 7 based on whether the user is providing filtering criteria
    - Intent 3 and 6 should only be identified when user explicitly mentions the word sort/arrange/order or other equivalent terms
    ''',
            }
